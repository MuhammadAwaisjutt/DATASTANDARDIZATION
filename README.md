# DATASTANDARDIZATION
cancer dataset use for preprocessing. import libraries (numpy , pandas , sklrarn  preprocessing, standar scaler).  we are importing some libraries numpy is useful for creating numpy arrays.Pandas  in which we are going to use standardize our datasets.Training and testing data from sklearn dataset we get the sample of dataset.it is useful to create data frames that is structured data which is use to more help in analysis so the standard sclar function.  we are importing some libraries numpy is useful for creating numpy arrays.Pandas  in which we are going to use standardize our datasets.Training and testing data from sklearn dataset we get the sample of dataset.it is useful to create data frames that is structured data which is use to more help in analysis so the standard sclar function.loadind the data pandas frame.Splitting the data into training data and test data.You can see these values are very close to each other between 0 and 1 but as you can see previous the X have values seventeen , twenty and have thousands and two thousands etc. Now you can see that the values are in similar range.
